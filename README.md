# Introduction
Score Tracker is an app for the Google Assistant platform. It uses Firebase's realtime database to store user's game data and persist it between conversations with the Assistant. You can invoke it on the Google Assistant mobile app or a Google Home by saying "OK Google, talk to Score Tracker."

# Description
Can't remember your score after an intense round or long break? Want to keep track of a long-term series? Then Score Tracker is for you!

Score Tracker records any number of players' scores for any game that requires keeping track of points. Score tracker could work with games like bags, table tennis, air hockey, or even trading card games. 

Score Tracker never forgets the players in a game or their scores, so it's also perfect to keep track of standings during long-term competitions. Use it to keep track of how many tasks everyone has done, or how many times you've beaten your friend in FIFA whether it's the next day, month, or year. 

After adding all the players in the skill, you can update the scores of any of the players by asking Google to add or remove points from certain players or the whole group. You can also set the scores of certain players or the whole group to a specific amount.
